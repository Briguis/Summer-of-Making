# 🚗 Blackstone Garage

Hi! My name is **Briguiss**, and this is a project I built in about **8 hours**.

**Blackstone Garage** is a fictional **luxury car dealership website** with a focus on a **minimalist, bold, and elegant design** — just like the brand it represents.  
The name combines my passion for **obsidian** and **high-end automobiles**.

## 🌐 About the Project

The goal of the site is to present the **Blackstone Garage** brand with impact and style.

Upon entering, the user is greeted with:
- An **intro animation** featuring the **brand name (Blackstone)**  
- An **egocentric slogan**:  
  **"True luxury belongs to those who choose Blackstone Garage"**
- A stylized image of a **speedometer**, reinforcing the brand identity

After the intro, the page displays:
- A highlight of the brand's identity and mission
- A showroom area designed to showcase categories of cars:
  - **Luxury**
  - **Sedan**
  - **Sports**
  - **Vintage**
  - **SUV**
  - **Coupe**
  - **Convertible**
- A **simple footer** to wrap up the experience

I also included a file called `menu.js` which was meant to:
- Detect scroll events and dynamically change the **header background color** and **logo**
- Hide the **header** after scrolling past a certain margin

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn’t able to finish this part — but the base code is already there.
